Programming Languages

As we know, to communicate with a person, we need a specific language, similarly to communicate with computers, programmers also need a language is called Programming language.
Before learning the programming language, let's understand what is language?

What is Language?

Language is a type of communication that is used to share information with each other. For example, if we want to teach someone, we need a language that is understandable by both communicators.

What is a Programming Language?

A programming language is a computer language that is used by programmers (developers) to communicate with computers. It is a set of instructions written in any specific language (C, C++, Java, Python) to perform a specific task.
A programming language is mainly used to develop desktop applications, websites, and mobile applications.

Categories of programming languages

1. Low-level programming language
Low-level  language is machine-dependent programming language. The processor runs low- level programs directly without the need of a compiler or interpreter, so the programs written in low-level language can be run very fast.
i. Machine Language. 
It is also called as machine code or object code. Machine language is easier to read by machines because it is normally displayed in binary or hexadecimal form. It does not require a translator to convert the programs because computers directly understand the machine language programs.
The advantage of machine language is that it helps the programmer to execute the programs faster than the high-level programming language.
ii. Assembly Language
This language is designed for specific processors. It represents the set of instructions in a symbolic and human-understandable form. It uses an assembler to convert the assembly language to machine language.

2. High-level programming language
High-level programming language (HLL) is designed for developing user-friendly software programs and websites. This programming language requires a compiler or interpreter to translate the program into machine language.
The main advantage of a high-level language is that it is easy to read, write, and maintain.
High-level programming language includes Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP, C#, C++, Objective C, Perl and many others.
A high-level language is divided into three parts:
i. Procedural Oriented programming languages
These languages divides a program into small procedures called routines or functions. 
The advantage of POP language is that it helps programmers to easily track the program flow and code can be reused in different parts of the program.
Example: C, FORTRAN, Basic, Pascal.
ii. Object-Oriented Programming languages
These languages are based upon the objects and programs are divided into small parts called objects. It is used to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, etc in the program to make the program reusable, efficient, and easy-to-use.
The main advantage of object-oriented programming is that OOP is faster and easier to execute, maintain, modify, as well as debug.
Example: C++, Java, Python.

Top-3 programming languages on GitHub

According to GitHub annual report the most popular programming language on this resource is JavaScript. The second and third prize in this chart achieved Python and Java accordingly. Let`s take a short tour on these leaders among programming languages.

JavaScript

JavaScript is a type of scripting language that is used on both client-side and server-side. It is developed in the 1990s for the Netscape Navigator web browser. It allows programmers to implement complex features to make web pages alive. It helps programmers to create dynamic websites, servers, mobile applications, animated graphics, games, and more.
Advantages
•	Can run immediately within the client-side browser.
•	Reduces the demand on the website server.
•	JavaScript is a simple, versatile, and lightweight programming language.
•	Used everywhere on the web.
•	JavaScript and its syntax are easy to understand.
Disadvantages
•	Can sometimes be interpreted differently by different browsers which makes it difficult to write cross-browser code.
•	It is less secure compared to other programming languages.

Python

Python is one of the most widely used user-friendly programming languages. It is an open-source and easy to learn programming language developed in the 1990s. It is mostly used in Machine learning, Artificial intelligence, Big Data, GUI based desktop applications, and Robotics.
Advantages
•	Python is easy to read, easy to understand, and easy to write.
•	It integrates with other programming languages like C, C++, and Java.
•	Python is cross-platform that means you can write code once and run it anywhere.
Disadvantages
•	Python is not suitable for developing mobile applications and games.
•	Python works with the interpreter. That's why it is slower than other programming languages like C and C++.

Java

Java is a simple, secure, platform-independent, reliable, architecture-neutral high-level programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995. Now, Java is owned by Oracle. It is mainly used to develop bank, retail, information technology, android, big data, research community, web, and desktop applications.
Advantages
•	Java is easy to write, compile, learn, and debug.
•	Cross- platform.
•	It is a highly secured programming language.
•	It is capable of performing multiple tasks at the same time.
Disadvantages
•	Java consumes more memory and slower than other programming languages like C or C++.
